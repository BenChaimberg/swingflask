Swing Paints manufactures universal and stain-blocking primers for use as paint primers and wallpaper prep-coats. All primers are water-based, low odour and can be used for interior and exterior applications.

The company manufactures specialty epoxy coatings. A two-component brush-on epoxy is a consumer/DIY product for repainting bathtubs, tiles, and sinks. A two-component spray epoxy, with two-component primer, is designed for commercial tub reglazers and appliance repairs, as well as for food preparation areas. A two-component high-build (extremely thick) clear epoxy is used for arts and craft, displays and for commercial restaurant and bar tables.
