Functional Specification
================
_Swing Paints Ltd._ is a family-owned business that has been operating in Canada since 1965. 
The company produces various products for do-it-yourself and industrial use in the areas of wood finishing, painting and cleaning.
 
The current [web site](www.swingpaints.com) was created in 2001 to provide direct internet access to product information, dealer locations, contacts, etc.  Over the years, an interactive forum and online purchasing option were added to the site.
We propose to have the web site upgraded and redesigned to satisfy our current and future needs.
 
1. Replace all SWF files (Shockwave Flash) to a format that provides for simple modification and support on all browsers and mobile platforms.
2. Redesign the Home Page to allow for simple addition of new categories.
3. Redesign the Product Page to allow for simple addition of new products.
4. Redesign the Product Page to include tab views
 
The coder will coordinate with marketing to ensure the web site synchronizes with product packaging and other promotional tools.
