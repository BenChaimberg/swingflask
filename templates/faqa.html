<ol><li>What is the best stripper to use to remove paint?</li></ol>
<p>There are three factors that determine the most appropriate paint stripper: type of paint, type of surface, location. Circa 1850 Furniture Stripper works best on most paints and clear finishes (varnishes, polyurethanes, lacquers). Its liquid formula is preferred for clear finishes and intricate surfaces. Circa 1850 Heavy Body Remover is a gel-type stripper that works best on tough, multiple layers of paint, exterior surfaces such as houses and boats. Its cling formula is ideal for walls and moldings. Circa 1850 Soft Strip is a biodegradable environmentally-friendly remover. Its pleasant odour is ideal for interior use, while its slow evaporation make it perfect for exterior use. It is very effective on latex and epoxy finishes.</p>
<p>Gaudrault Antiques Removers (Brush-on, Heavy Body and Stay-Wet) are economical alternatives to the Circa 1850 products. Gaudrault Antiques Removers are slightly slower acting and require more applications to remove multiple layers of paint.</p>
<p>Swing Professional Removers (Flo, Liquid and Gel) are formulated for professional use only.</p>
